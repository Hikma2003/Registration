# Registration
The Registration System for Haramaya University CCI College is a Java program that allows students to register for courses based on their eligibility and department selection.
The program prompts the user for their information, such as name, gender, ID, UID, and GPA, and then checks if the student is eligible for registration. 
If eligible, the program displays the available departments and their corresponding courses for the student to choose from. After selecting a department,
the student can enter the semester they wish to start and register for the courses offered in that semester.


 I wanted to make the system flexible and adaptable to different scenarios and requirements.
 I also wanted to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts and skills that I have learned in Java programming.
 I hope that you will appreciate my effort and creativity in creating this system.
 Thank you for your time and attention.
 Sincerely,
     HIKMA JEMAL
